# Deduplicating a Doubly Linked List

## Problem

Start with a doubly-linked list of 200 nodes with random values between 1 and 100. Now remove any nodes as required, so that each value is only in the list no more than one time.

An example with values less than 10:

Input:

 8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 4 <=> 9 <=> 4 <=> 8 <=> 8 <=> 1 <=> 3
Output:

 8 <=> 4 <=> 2 <=> 9 <=> 1 <=> 3
